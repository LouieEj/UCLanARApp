# UCLanARApp
An augmented reality (AR) mobile application for Android 8.1+ devices to help UCLan university students with disabilities learn about different areas of the UCLan campus. The app was developed as part of a team-work assignment for CO2403 The Agile Professional over the course of 2-3 months.

## Features
- Login/register system using a local database.
- Settings stored to local database.
- Settings for interface font (regular or dyslexic-friendly), and for colourblind filter.
- AR and location tracking to show students a tour of university buildings.
- AR objects show at university buildings to give information on the buildings and university.
- Text-to-speech button ("Read aloud") says the information about university buildings aloud when pressed.

## Limitations
- Location tracking sometimes not very accurate.
- Compass tracking sometimes not very accurate (may be offset by a specific angle on boot).
- Text-to-speech does not check where the user is, says information about university buildings in order.

## Future work
- Add speech-to-text commands.
- Improve the reliability of the location based AR and route navigation.
- Test the app with students who would benefit from the tools in the app.
